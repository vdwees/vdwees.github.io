Have you ever found yourself waiting for a microwave, and wished you could walk away
and get a reminder when its done?
Or maybe you are vision-impaired and would like an app to read aloud how much time is left on the machine.
That's what this app is for.
 
Devices like microwaves, washing machines, and ovens have displays, usually electronic seven-segment displays to indicate how long until the machine is done (the ones in my house do, at least).

7seg uses some advanced computer vision techniques to extract the digits out of timer displays, with first-class support for seven-segment displays.

# Troubleshooting
For best performance, ensure timer display is clean, well-lit and free of glare.
If the timer screen is glossy, you might have better success when holding the camera
at a slight angle.

# Limitations
Computer vision is challenging, and some digital timer manufacturers seem to think that they
should make their timer displays as complex and glossy as possible.
Indeed, digital timers have been around for a while and there is a huge range of designs.

I wish I could say this app supports all timers, but its possible it does not support one of yours. If you'd like me to try and support a particular timer, feel free to send me relevant pictures and info via email, keeping in mind that some timers or lighting environments will always be out of scope.

In any case, this app is provided as-is.
Use it at your own risk.
It's really not suitable for situations where someone could get hurt.
