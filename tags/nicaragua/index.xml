It is also remarkably amendable to convert into a dune buggy: its engine is famously located in the rear of the vehicle, finding parts is trivial, and, due to its age, the electrical system is extremely simple.

Some Background The Nicaraguan non-profit I was working for was set up to improve access to healthcare for extremely rural communities.</description></item></channel></rss>
