## Volkswagen Beetle

The [Volkswagen Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle) is
possibly the most iconic vehicle of the 20th century. It is also remarkably
amendable to becoming a dune buggy: the engine is famously located in the
rear of the vehicle, finding parts is trivial, and, due to its age, the
electrical system is extremely simple.

When I moved to Nicaragua in elementary school, my dad promised me that we
would build a dune buggy together. My dad to make good on his promise, and in
2006 he bought a mid-1960's Beetle for about $500 USD.

## Construction

As soon as we had our hands on the vehicle, we set upon it with grinders and
cutting wheels and acetylene torches, extracting the body from the chassis. We
also had to cut out the floor pans, as they had rusted through. Luckily the
central stiffening tube was still solid.

After taking the vehicle apart, the project lost momentum. I was eager to see
it happen, but still too young to be much help when reassembling the vehicle.
It wasn't until 2010 when I was a bit older that I took on some of the
initiative to get the reassembly underway. The first thing I did was rebuild
the engine. It had been exposed to the elements for a few years at this point,
so everything needed to be checked or replaced. I got a lot of help from a
mechanic to make sure this was done right.

I don't have any pictures from this step, but a great resource for learning
about four-stroke engines is Bartosz Ciechanowski's blog post about [Internal
Combustion Engines](https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/). The
interactive 3D models in that post are similar to the Volkswagen engine and the
principals are identical.

As I was still in high school, at some point my dad contracted some people to
help out with the rest of the build, especially the frame. I continued to help
out at the shop whenever I had a chance.

## Album

I think the dune buggy turned out pretty cool in the end! Thanks to its light
body and rear wheel drive, it was great for drifting and ripping holes in the
baseball field. I also drove it to school throughout high school. If my hair
was wet when rushing out the door, I was sure to have very windswept look that
day.

At some point I even made a short video and posted it on youtube, although the
resolution is pretty poor by today's standards. Notice the lack of ABS in the
first few frames. Also missing: power steering and a windshield.
