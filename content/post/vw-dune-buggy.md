When I moved to Nicaragua in elementary school, my dad promised me that we
would build a dune buggy together. I was worried about the move, but certain
that if I had this exciting project to look forward to, everything would be OK.

## A Volkswagen Beetle

The classic [Volkswagen
Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle) is possibly the most
iconic vehicle of the 20th century. It is also remarkably amendable to convert
into a dune buggy: its engine is famously located in the rear of the vehicle,
finding parts is trivial, and, due to its age, the electrical system is
extremely simple.

At some point I must have pestered my dad to make good on his promise, so he
found one made in the mid-1960's for about $500 USD.

## Disassembly

I'm not sure any plans were ever drawn up when converting the Beetle. Moments
after getting our hands on the vehicle, we set upon it with grinders and
cutting wheels and acetylene torches, extracting the body from the chassis. We
also had to cut out the floor pans, as they had rusted through. Luckily the
central stiffening tube was still solid.

## Assembly

Having taken the vehicle apart, the adults involved ended up too busy to take
the next steps, and I  was still too young to know where to start on
reassembling the vehicle. It wasn't until 2010 when I was a bit older that I
took on some of the initiative to get the reassembly underway.

The first thing we did was rebuild the engine. It had been exposed to the
elements for too long, so everything needed to be checked over. I got a lot of
help from a mechanic to make sure this was done right. I don't have any
pictures from this step, but a great resource for learning about four-stroke
engines is Bartosz Ciechanowski's blog post about [Internal Combustion
Engines](https://ciechanow.ski/internal-combustion-engine/). The interactive 3D
models in that post are similar to the Volkswagen engine and the principals are
identical.

As I was still in high school, at some point my dad contracted some people to
help out with the rest of the build, in particular the frame. I continued to
help out at the shop when I could. In the end, the dune buggy ended up looking
pretty cool.
