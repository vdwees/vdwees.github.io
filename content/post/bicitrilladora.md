One summer when I was too inexperienced an engineer to find a real internship,
I ended up with a volunteer position working at a non-profit working under a
Nicaraguan engineer. Needless to say, the summer was an eventful one and I
have many good memories and stories from that summer. One of my favorite
projects was the design and construction of the "bicitrilladora".

## Why this thing?

The Nicaraguan non-profit I was working for was set up to improve access to
healthcare for extremely rural communities. The villages they served were very
hard to get to, often requiring multiple days of travel involving 4x4 trucks,
Cessnas and dugout canoes. Conversely, a farmer in one of the more rural
villages could expect multiple days, substantial risk and great personal
expense to get their products to market.

The organization I was working for had observed that their best attempts to
improve healthcare access would have only marginal impact unless they also
worked to address some of the underlying reasons for why these agrarian
villages were unable to get treatment. And one of the most significant factors
at play was that many people simply could not afford even the most subsidized
healthcare treatment. Therefore, an improvement in the economic prospects of a
community would translate directly into better access to healthcare for that
community.

Due to its stable shelf-life, the most common export from a village was rice.
Before it can be cooked, rice must be dehulled. As dehulled rice is much more
valuable by weight, my organization decided to invest some R&D in dehulling
technology that might be feasible in a rural community. A successful technology
could significantly improve a farmer's profitability and, consequently,
healthcare.

## A Prototype

Some villages are not so far from a road or major river and can bring in
gasoline to run a generator occasionally. Others are limited to a community
solar panel to charge a cell phone or a pocket radio, or import power in the
form of AA batteries purchased downriver. Human power, on the other hand, is
readily available.

For small batches of rice, such as for a family meal, it is possible to dehull
rice with a large mortar and pestle, but this ancient tool is unsurprisingly
too slow and exhausting for a farmer to process even their small yields, which
are measured in 25 kg sacks.

But what if we somehow attached a small commercial rice dehuller to a set of
bike pedals? A reasonably fit human can produce a steady 100 W for one hour on
a bicycle, this was tantalizingly close to the lower power limit on the smallest
commercial rice dehuller we could buy in town. Could we harness human power to
dehull rice efficiently? To answer the question, I was to work on a prototype.

The construction and design of the prototype can be seen in the following photos.

##  Results


Points to address
- effort required
- quality of product
- did it actually get used
