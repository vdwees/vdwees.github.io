One summer when I was too inexperienced an engineer to find a real internship,
I ended up with a volunteer position working at a non-profit working under a
Nicaraguan engineer. Needless to say, the summer was an eventful one and I
have many good memories and stories from that summer. One of my favorite
projects was the design and construction of the "bicitrilladora".

## Some Background

The Nicaraguan non-profit I was working for was set up to improve access to
healthcare for extremely rural communities. The villages they served were very
hard to get to, often requiring multiple days of travel involving 4x4 trucks,
Cessnas and dugout canoes. Conversely, the villagers could expect delays,
substantial risk and great personal expense to get their products to market.

The organization I was working for had observed that their best attempts to
improve healthcare access would have only marginal impact unless they also
worked to address some of the underlying reasons for why these villages were
unable to get treatment. One of the most significant factors at play was that
many people simply could not afford even the most subsidized healthcare
treatment. An improvement in the economic prospects of a community would
translate directly into better access to healthcare for that community.

Due to its stable shelf-life, the most common export from a village is rice.
Before it can be cooked, rice must be dehulled. Dehulled rice is more
valuable by weight, so my organization decided to invest some R&D in dehulling
technology that might be feasible in a rural community. A successful technology
could significantly improve a farmer's profitability and, consequently,
healthcare.

## A Prototype

Some villages are not so far from a road or major river and can bring in
gasoline to run a generator occasionally. Others are limited to a community
solar panel to charge a cell phone or a pocket radio, or import power in the
form of AA batteries purchased downriver. Human power, on the other hand, is
readily available.

For small batches of rice, such as for a family meal, it is possible to dehull
rice with a large mortar and pestle, but this ancient tool is unsurprisingly
too slow and exhausting for a farmer to process even their small yields, which
are measured in 25 kg sacks.

But what if we somehow attached a small commercial rice dehuller to a set of
bike pedals? A reasonably fit human can produce a steady 100 W for one hour on
a bicycle, this was tantalizingly close to the lower power limit on the smallest
commercial rice dehuller we could buy in town. Could we harness human power to
dehull rice efficiently? To answer the question, I was to work on a prototype.

The construction and design of the prototype can be seen in the following photos.

##  Results

Once assembled, the prototype was delivered to a rural community for testing. A
lot of people enjoyed using the machine, almost equally as a way to show off
how fast they could pedal as to extract the rice itself. Pedalling the
bicitrilladora was not at all unlike spin class, and a few operators would be
able to process a sack of rice in under two hours, much faster and easier than
the traditional method.

It took a bit of practice to operate the dehuller itself. Common issues were
broken grains and grains still in the hull, as seen in the picture. Ultimately,
I don't think any more of this machine was made, however in my mind the
limiting factor was not the pedal-power but rather the rather finicky commercial
dehuller that we were using. Even so, the bicitrilladora was still viewed as
preferable by many users over the traditional pounding method.
