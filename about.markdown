I have an unhealthy addiction to tinkering on the computers around my house.
These days travel is limited, so I spend a lot of time playing with the frameworks and technologies that I don't have the opportunity to work with at my day job. 

If I manage to put together something interesting enough to share, I'll post it here.

Maybe one day I burn out and join the army- who knows?
